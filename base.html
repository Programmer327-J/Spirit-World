        <h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <p>Base 27 originally started as Base 13, before it was burned down back in 2016 by ex-Seraphim member, Evelyn.</p>
    <p>When the base was created, it was originally a small warehouse, set with basic necessities. Over time, it grew into a full agency with barracks and office spaces for the members of the Seraphim.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Members:</h2>
    <p>Base 27 is currently inhabited by the main group, and around 15,000 soldiers. The main group consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Seraph/Aeryx Rose: Leader of Base 27 and head of Delta Squad.</li>
        <li>Katherine Whiterose: Accountant and Second-in-Command.</li>
        <li>Ruby Brookhaven: Mission Delegator.</li>
        <li>Delta 1-5: The main members of Delta Squad and the best of the best. Names have been expunged from Seraphim records due to anonymity.</li>
        <li>Evelyn Brookhaven: Older sister of Ruby and manager of the armory.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Current status.</h2>
    <p>Base 27 has been the main area of operations since August 2016, and plays host to the most fun and the most interesting people this side of an external reality.</p>

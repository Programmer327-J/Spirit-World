    <h2>Who is Azeroth?</h2>
    <p>Azeroth, more commonly known as Azzy by his friends, is the representation of Seraph's anger, and acts as the bridge between control and a lack thereof.</p>
    <p>Azeroth also gives Seraph the ability to glitch around, both in and out of reality, making them unpredicable.</p>
